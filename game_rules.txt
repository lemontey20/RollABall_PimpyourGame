Collectables:
- 3 types. Their type (defined randomly) is unknown before collision.
- all types: when collision whith the player, it disappears with a sound depending of its type
- type 1 : the player win X1 game points
- type 2 : the player win X2 game points + the player wins Y1 life points
- type 3 : the player win X3 game points + the player wins Y2 life points + inverted chase period begins

Inverted chase period:
- a time counter appears with Z1 seconds
- all enemies become chased
- at each second the time counter decreases
- during the Z2 last seconds, the color of the counter is different
